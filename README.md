# Pollard's kangaroo for SECPK1

A Pollard's kangaroo interval ECDLP solver for SECP256K1 (based on VanitySearch engine).\
**This program is limited to a 125bit interval search.**


# Fork for: Sparse range (search with stride)
Special parameters:
```
    -stride
    -checksum
```

Usage:
This fork allows search with stride different than 1, so it could be useful for solving WIFs with missing characters.\
For example, let's take WIF: **5HrdZxkxnVst8Q3qCLJkeiLe1k4AmSDaAhqQVUYVxVSBkf5VfUu** which encodes the private key _0552e025571c01bcda0297c22731d74becbd30d07e4ec355c741825fffc0a672_.\
Decoded WIF shows checksum **524412ca**\
The corresponding public key is _04777c026b8085951da7117395bf269c055f36bf2ddf623281962855edee36d4e73bec2fa87b122a0f1b2841ef4f7afdec2443f89c151ee2597feac18ae0d62bdf_ 

# Search without checksum (_large_ stride)
Let's take WIF **5HrdZxkxnVst8Q_____keiLe1k4AmSDaAhqQVUYVxVSBkf5VfUu**\
Now, we may find the first WIF to be tested, it will be 5HrdZxkxnVst8Q11111keiLe1k4AmSDaAhqQVUYVxVSBkf5VfUu. When we decode it, we find the private key which is the beginning of our range: **0552e025571c01bcd9eda59365a2fb3ae0bd7547dfeeeb13d971d848bcbf0467**\
Now, we must calculate the number of WIFs in our range. Beause we have 5 missing characters, it will be 58^5 = 656356768 (271f35a0 hex)\
To have the end of range for Kangaroo, we must calculate _fake end_ which is _start_ + _range_
```
new BigInteger("0552e025571c01bcd9eda59365a2fb3ae0bd7547dfeeeb13d971d848bcbf0467",16).add(new BigInteger("656356768",10)).toString(16) =
552e025571c01bcd9eda59365a2fb3ae0bd7547dfeeeb13d971d848e3de3a07
```

We check where is the most right unknown character - it's position will tell us what is the stride. In our case it is 58^32 = **af820335d9b3d9cf58b911d87035677fb7f528100000000**\
Because WIFs encodes checksum, we must observe if stride _collides_ with checksum. Fortunately - not, because the last 8 characters (length of checksum) are 0s. We may remove these zeros and get _shorter_ stride.\
The final configuration file is:
```
552e025571c01bcd9eda59365a2fb3ae0bd7547dfeeeb13d971d848bcbf0467

# Search with checksum (_small_ stride) - unstable!
Let's take WIF **5HrdZxkxnVst8Q3qCLJkeiLe1k4Am____hqQVUYVxVSBkf5VfUu**\
Now, we may find the first WIF to be tested, it will be 5HrdZxkxnVst8Q3qCLJkeiLe1k4Am1111hqQVUYVxVSBkf5VfUu. When we decode it, we find the private key which is the beginning of our range: **0552e025571c01bcda0297c22731d74becbd30cfb218f04dc91299473f61ffde**\
Now, we must calculate the number of WIFs in our range. Beause we have 4 missing characters, it will be 58^4 = 11316496\
To have the end of range for Kangaroo, we must calculate _fake end_ which is _start_ + _range_
```
new BigInteger("0552e025571c01bcda0297c22731d74becbd30cfb218f04dc91299473f61ffde",16).add(new BigInteger("11316496",10)).toString(16) =
552e025571c01bcda0297c22731d74becbd30cfb218f04dc9129947400eacee
```
We check where is the most right unknown character - it's position will tell us what is the stride. In our case it is 58^18 = **2b85840fc1d6a480ae7fa240000**\
Unfortunately the stride collides with checksum (last 8 characters are not 0s). It means that for our calculations we must take into account **the proper checksum** And this is difficult part, because the _real_ checksum is unknown. In our test it is known, but in real-life it could be needed to see how many possibilities there are. For example, in this case, playing with missing characters of WIF we may observe that last 4 characters of checksum are fixed. The first 4 could be changed, BUT the 4th character gets only 4 values. It means that if we want to use this method for real-life problem, we may need to do calculations for 16 *16 *16 *4 checksums (in fact will ne less operations needed, because many checksums will generate the same private key in addition to the stride). \
\
Because stride collides with checksum, we will have to use the full (long) value and pass checksum as a parameter.\

# Note on Time/Memory tradeoff of the DP method

The distinguished point (DP) method is an efficient method for storing random walks and detect collision between them. Instead of storing all points of all kangagroo's random walks, we store only points that have an x value starting with dpBit zero bits. When 2 kangaroos collide, they will then follow the same path because their jumps are a function of their x values. The collision will be then detected when the 2 kangaroos reach a distinguished point.\
This has a drawback when you have a lot of kangaroos and looking for collision in a small range as the overhead is in the order of nbKangaroo.2<sup>dpBit</sup> until a collision is detected. If dpBit is too small a large number of point will enter in the central table, will decrease performance and quickly fill the RAM.
**Powerfull GPUs with large number of cores won't be very efficient on small range, you can try to decrease the grid size in order to have less kangaroos but the GPU performance may not be optimal.**
Yau can change manualy the DP mask size using the -d option, take in consideration that it will require more operations to complete. See table below:

| nbKangaroo.2<sup>dpBit</sup>/sqrt(N) |  DP Overhead | Avg | 
|--------------------------------------|:------------:|:---:|
| 4.000 | cubicroot(1+4.000) = ~71.0% | 3.55 sqrt(N) |
| 2.000 | cubicroot(1+2.000) = ~44.2% | 2.99 sqrt(N) |
| 1.000 | cubicroot(1+1.000) = ~26.0% | 2.62 sqrt(N) |
| 0.500 | cubicroot(1+0.500) = ~14.5% | 2.38 sqrt(N) |
| 0.250 | cubicroot(1+0.250) = ~7.7% | 2.24 sqrt(N) |
| 0.125 | cubicroot(1+0.125) = ~4.0% | 2.16 sqrt(N) |

DP overhead according to the range size (N), DP mask size (dpBit) and number of kangaroos running in paralell (nbKangaroo).

Note that restarting a client without having a kangaroo backup is like adding more kangaroos, when you merge workfiles coming from different kangaroos, it is also like having more kangaroos.

# How to deal with work files

You can save periodicaly work files using -w -wi -ws options. When you save a work file, if it does not contain the kangaroos (-ws) you will lost a bit of work due to the DP overhead, so if you want to continue a file on a same configuration it is recommended to use -ws. To restart a work, use the -i option, the input ascii file is not needed.\
When you continue a work file on a different hardware, or using a different number of bits for the distinguished points, or a different number of kangaroos, you will also get an overhead.\
However, work files are compatible (same key and range) and can be merged, if 2 work files have a different number of distinguished bits, the lowest will be recorded in the destination file.\
If you have several hosts with different configurations, it is preferable to use -ws on each host and then merge all files from time to time in order to check if the key can be solved. When a merge solve a key, no output file is written. A merged file does not contain kangaroos.

Start a work from scratch and save work file every 30 seconds:
```
Kangaroo.exe -ws -w save.work -wi 30 in.txt
```

Continue the work from save.work and save work file every 30 seconds:
```
Kangaroo.exe -ws -w save.work -wi 30 -i save.work
```

Note on the wsplit option:

In order to avoid to handle a big hashtable in RAM, it is possible to save it and reset it at each backup. It will save a work file with a prefix at each backup and reset the hashtable in RAM. Then a merge can be done offline and key solved by merge. Even with a small hashtable, the program may also solve the key as paths continue and collision may occur in the small hashtable so don't forget to use -o option when using server(s). 

Exemple with a 64bit key:
```
Kangaroo.exe -d 10 -s -w save.work -wsplit -wi 10 ..\VC_CUDA8\in64.txt

```

Note on -wss option:

The wss option allow to use the server to make kangaroo backups, the client send kangaroo (in compressed format) to the server. When a client restart with -wss option, it tries to download the backup. If the specified file is not found by the server, the client creates new kangaroos. There is no need to use -i option here. Make sure when restarting a new job with a different range or key, that the client does not download an old backup. Make sure that when a backup is downloaded, that no kangaroos are created or not handled by the client. This option is usefull if you cannot rely on client side to handle kangaoo backup.

Send kangaroo to the server every 20 second and, when starting, try to download kang.
```
./kangaroo -w kang -wss -wi 20 -c pcjlpons
```

# Distributed clients and central server(s)

It is possible to run Kangaroo in client/server mode. The server has the same options as the standard program except that you have to specify manually the number of distinguished point bits number using -d. All clients which connect will get back the configuration from the server. At the moment, the server is limited to one single key. If you restart the server with a different configuration (range or key), you need to stop all clients otherwise they will reconnect and send wrong points.

Starting the server with backup every 5 min, 12 distinguished bits, in64.txt as config file:

pons@linpons:~/Kangaroo$./kangaroo -w save.work -wi 300 -o result.txt -s -d 12 in64.txt
```
**Warning**: The server is very simple and has no authentication mechanism, so if you want to export it on the net, use at your own risk.

Starting client, using gpu and connect to the server linpons, backup kangaroos every 10min:
```
Kangaroo.exe -t 0 -gpu -w kang.work -wi 600 -c linpons
```

![Client server architecture](DOC/architecture.jpg)

**What to do in case of a server crash:**\
When the server is stopped, clients wait for reconnection, so simply restart it, no need to reload a backup if using wsplit (recommended).\
**What to do in case of a client crash:**\
Retart the client using the last kangaroos backup:
```
Kangaroo.exe -t 0 -gpu -i kang.work -w kang.work -wi 600 -c linpons
```
When the client restart from backup, it will produce duplicate points (counted as dead kangaroos) until it reaches its progress before the crash. It is important to restart the client with its backup, otherwise new kangaroos are created and the DP overhead increases.

To build such an architecture, the total number of kangaroo running in parallel must be know at the starting time to estimate the DP overhead. **It is not recommended to add or remove clients during running time**, the number of kangaroo must be constant.

This program solved puzzle #110 in 2.1 days (109 bit key on the Secp256K1 field) using this architecture on 256 Tesla V100. It required 2<sup>55.55</sup> group operations using DP25 to complete.
This program also solved #115 in 13 days (114 bit key on the Secp256K1 field). It required 2<sup>58.36</sup> group operations using DP25 to complete.

# Probability of success

The picture below show the probability of success after a certain number of group operations. N is range size.
This plot does not take into consideration the DP overhead.

# How it works

The program uses 2 herds of kangaroos, a tame herd and a wild herd. When 2 kangoroos (a wild one and a tame one) collide, the 
key can be solved. Due to the birthday paradox, a collision happens (in average) after 2.08*sqrt(k2-k1) [1] group operations, the 2 herds have the same size. To detect collision, the distinguished points method is used with a hashtable.

Here is a brief description of the algorithm:

We have to solve P = k.G, P is the public key, we know that k lies in the range [k1,k2], G is the SecpK1 generator point.\
Group operations are additions on the elliptic curve, scalar operations are done modulo the order of the curve.

n = floor(log2(sqrt(k2-k1)))+1

* Create a jump point table jP = [G,2G,4G,8G,...,2<sup>n-1</sup>.G]
* Create a jump distance table jD = [1,2,4,8,....,2<sup>n-1</sup>]
 
for all i in herdSize</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tame<sub>i</sub> = rand(0..(k2-k1)) <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tamePos<sub>i</sub> = (k1+tame<sub>i</sub>).G <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wild<sub>i</sub> = rand(0..(k2-k1)) - (k2-k1)/2 <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wildPos<sub>i</sub> = P + wild<sub>i</sub>.G <em># Group operation</em></br>

found = false</br>

while not found</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for all i in herdSize</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  tamePos<sub>i</sub> = tamePos<sub>i</sub> + jP[tamePos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  tame<sub>i</sub> += jD[tamePos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  wildPos<sub>i</sub> = wildPos<sub>i</sub> + jP[wildPos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  wild<sub>i</sub> += jD[wildPos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if tamePos<sub>i</sub> is distinguished</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  add (TAME,tamePos<sub>i</sub>,tame<sub>i</sub>) to hashTable</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if wildPos<sub>i</sub> is distinguished</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  add (WILD,wildPos<sub>i</sub>,wild<sub>i</sub>) to hashTable</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;found = is there a collision in hashTable between a tame and a wild kangaroo ?</br>
</br>

(Tame,Wild) = Collision</br>
k = k1 + Tame.dist - Wild.dist</br>


Here is an illustration of what's happening. When 2 paths collide they form a shape similar to the lambda letter. This is why this method is also called lambda method.

# Compilation

## Windows

Install CUDA SDK 10.2 and open VC_CUDA102\Kangaroo.sln in Visual C++ 2019.\
You may need to reset your *Windows SDK version* in project properties.\
In Build->Configuration Manager, select the *Release* configuration.\
Build and enjoy.\
\
Note: The current release has been compiled with Visual studio 2019 and CUDA SDK 10.2, if you have a different release of the CUDA SDK, you may need to update CUDA SDK paths in Kangaroo.vcxproj using a text editor. The current nvcc option are set up to architecture starting at 3.0 capability, for older hardware, add the desired compute capabilities to the list in GPUEngine.cu properties, CUDA C/C++, Device, Code Generation.

Visual Studio 2015 + Cuda 8 => Take project files in VC_CUDA8\
Visual Sutido 2017 + Cuda 10 => Take project files in VC_CUDA10 (project files might be out of date)\
Visual Studio 2019 + Cuda10.2 => Take project files in VC_CUDA102\

## Linux

Install CUDA SDK.\
Depending on the CUDA SDK version and on your Linux distribution you may need to install an older g++ (just for the CUDA SDK).\
Edit the makefile and set up the good CUDA SDK path and appropriate compiler for nvcc. 

```
CUDA       = /usr/local/cuda-8.0
CXXCUDA    = /usr/bin/g++-4.8
```

You can enter a list of architecture (refer to nvcc documentation) if you have several GPU with different architecture. Compute capability 2.0 (Fermi) is deprecated for recent CUDA SDK.
Kangaroo need to be compiled and linked with a recent gcc (>=7). The current release has been compiled with gcc 7.3.0.\
Go to the Kangaroo directory. ccap is the desired compute capability.

```
$ g++ -v
gcc version 7.3.0 (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04)
$ make all (for build without CUDA support)
or
$ make gpu=1 ccap=20 all
```
