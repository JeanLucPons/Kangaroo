# Note on Time/Memory tradeoff of the DP method

The distinguished point (DP) method is an efficent method for storing random walks and detect collision between them. Instead of storing all points of all kanagroo's random walks, we store only points that have an x value starting with dp zero bits. When 2 kangaroos collide, they will then follow the same path because their jumps are a function of their x values. The collsion will be then detected until the 2 kangaroos reach a distinguished point.\
This has a drawback when you have a lot of kangaroos and looking for collision in a small range as the overhead is in the order of nbKangaroo.2<sup>dp</sup> until a collision is detected. If dp is too small a large number of point will enter in the central table, will decrease performance and quickly fill the RAM.
**Powerfull GPUs with large number of cores won't be very efficient on small range, you can try to decrease the grid size in order to have less kangaroos but the GPU performance may not be optimal.**
Yau can change manualy the dp size using the -d option, take in considration that it will require about nbKangaroo.2<sup>dp</sup> more operations to complete.

# How to deal with work files

You can save periodiacaly work files using -w -wi -ws options. When you save a work file, if it does not contains the kangaroos (-ws) you will lost a bit of work due to the DP overhead, so if you want to continue a file on a same configuration it is recommended to use -ws. To restart a work, use the -i option, the input ascii file is not needed.\
When you continue a work file on a different hardware, or using a different number of bits for the distinguished points, or a different number of kangaroos, you will also get an overhead.\
However, work files are compatible (same key and range) and can be merged, if 2 work files have a different number of distinguished bits, the lowest will be recorded in the destination file.\
If you have several hosts with different configrations, it is preferable to use -ws on each host and then merge all files from time to time in order to check if the key can be solved. When a merge solve a key, no output file is written. A merged file does not contains kangaroos.

Start a work from scratch and save work file every 30 seconds:
```
Kangaroo.exe -ws -w save.work -wi 30 in.txt
```

Continue the work from save.work and save work file every 30 seconds:
```
Kangaroo.exe -ws -w save.work -wi 30 -i save.work
```

# How it works

The program uses 2 herds of kangaroos, a tame herd and a wild herd. When 2 kangoroos (a wild one and a tame one) collide, the 
key can be solved. Due to the birthday paradox, a collision happens (in average) after 2.08*sqrt(k2-k1) [1] group operations, the 2 herds have the same size. To detect collision, the distinguished points method is used with a hashtable.

Here is a brief description of the algorithm:

We have to solve P = k.G, P is the public key, we know that k lies in the range [k1,k2], G is the SecpK1 generator point.\
Group operations are additions on the elliptic curve, scalar operations are done modulo the order of the curve.

n = floor(log2(sqrt(k2-k1)))+1

* Create a jump point table jP = [G,2G,4G,8G,...,2<sup>n-1</sup>.G]
* Create a jump distance table jD = [1,2,4,8,....,2<sup>n-1</sup>]
 
for all i in herdSize</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tame<sub>i</sub> = rand(0..(k2-k1)) <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tamePos<sub>i</sub> = (k1+tame<sub>i</sub>).G <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wild<sub>i</sub> = rand(0..(k2-k1)) - (k2-k1)/2 <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wildPos<sub>i</sub> = P + wild<sub>i</sub>.G <em># Group operation</em></br>

found = false</br>

while not found</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for all i in herdSize</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  tamePos<sub>i</sub> = tamePos<sub>i</sub> + jP[tamePos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  tame<sub>i</sub> += jD[tamePos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  wildPos<sub>i</sub> = wildPos<sub>i</sub> + jP[wildPos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  wild<sub>i</sub> += jD[wildPos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if tamePos<sub>i</sub> is distinguished</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  add (TAME,tamePos<sub>i</sub>,tame<sub>i</sub>) to hashTable</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if wildPos<sub>i</sub> is distinguished</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  add (WILD,wildPos<sub>i</sub>,wild<sub>i</sub>) to hashTable</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;found = is there a collision in hashTable between a tame and a wild kangaroo ?</br>
</br>

(Tame,Wild) = Collision</br>
k = k1 + Tame.dist - Wild.dist</br>

# Compilation

## Windows

Install CUDA SDK and open Kangaroo.sln in Visual C++ 2017.\
You may need to reset your *Windows SDK version* in project properties.\
In Build->Configuration Manager, select the *Release* configuration.\
Build and enjoy.\
\
Note: The current release has been compiled with CUDA SDK 10.0, if you have a different release of the CUDA SDK, you may need to update CUDA SDK paths in Kangaroo.vcxproj using a text editor. The current nvcc option are set up to architecture starting at 3.0 capability, for older hardware, add the desired compute capabilities to the list in GPUEngine.cu properties, CUDA C/C++, Device, Code Generation.

## Linux

Install CUDA SDK.\
Depending on the CUDA SDK version and on your Linux distribution you may need to install an older g++ (just for the CUDA SDK).\
Edit the makefile and set up the good CUDA SDK path and appropriate compiler for nvcc. 

```
CUDA       = /usr/local/cuda-8.0
CXXCUDA    = /usr/bin/g++-4.8
```

You can enter a list of architecture (refer to nvcc documentation) if you have several GPU with different architecture. Compute capability 2.0 (Fermi) is deprecated for recent CUDA SDK.
Kangaroo need to be compiled and linked with a recent gcc (>=7). The current release has been compiled with gcc 7.3.0.\
Go to the Kangaroo directory. ccap is the desired compute capability.

```
$ g++ -v
gcc version 7.3.0 (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04)
$ make all (for build without CUDA support)
or
$ make gpu=1 ccap=20 all
